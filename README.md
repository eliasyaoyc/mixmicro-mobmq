### Requirements

YunLSP+ Maven Repository Configuration

> [Configuration Reference](https://github.com/misselvexu/Acmedcare-Maven-Nexus/blob/master/README.md)

### Quick Start

You can download binaries from [Release Repo](http://git.hgj.net/elve.xu/Mixmicro-Components) or [repo.hgj.net](http://nexus.hgj.net/).

*First* : unzip release package

```bash
$ tar -zxvf *.tar.gz
```

*Second* : startup & shutdown

```bash
$ sh ./bin/startup.sh -p production  
```

*Third* : check the application log

```bash
$ tail -f logs/start.log
```

> param: -p (optional): `production` | `dev`


### Building from Source

You donâ€™t need to build from source to use `Mix Micro Chaos Components` (binaries in [repo.hgj.net](http://nexus.hgj.net)), 
but if you want to try out the latest and greatest, 
`Mix Micro Chaos Components` can be easily built with the maven wrapper. You also need JDK 1.8.

*First* : git clone source from gitlab
 
```bash
$ git clone http://git.hgj.net/elve.xu/Mixmicro-Chaos.git
```

*Second* : build

```bash
$ mvn clean install
```

If you want to build with the regular `mvn` command, you will need [Maven v3.5.0 or above](https://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html).
